Hello, my name is Joaquin Sandoval. I am currently a student in the Masters of Environmental Data Science Program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I am excited to combine my background in Marine Ecology with strong data analysis and visualization skills to enhance coastal conservation efforts wherever I might go!
