    "text": "Is there a relationship between decreasing coral cover and corallivore abundance in Backreef sites around Mo’orea, French Polynesia?\nCoral reefs around the islands of Mo’orea are threatened by a variety of stressors such as cyclone activity and the outbreak of predatory sea stars (Acanthaster planci) that feed on coral tissue. As a response to these stressors, many locations around the island have undergone phase shifts in their benthic composition that involves the transformation of coral dominated communities to macroalgae dominated communities. In particular, the backreefs have been heavily transformed by the presence of Turbinaria, a well defended and persistent algae. I was interested if the resulting fish communities have changed as a result of this, particularly the abundance of Corallivores which feed primarily on scleractinian corals.\nThe following analyses involve two datasets, both from the Mo’orea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research.\nfish : describe the species abundance and estimated size distributions (total body length to the greatest precision possible) of fishes surveyed as part of MCR LTER’s annual reef fish monitoring program. This dataset will be filtered to Backreef sites and for the fine trophic level of Corallivore.\ncoral_cover : describe the percentage cover of all stony corals (Scleractinia, pooled among genera) and other major groups analyzed from 0.5 x 0.5 m photographic quadrats at the Backreef habitat at the Moorea Coral Reef LTER, French Polynesia.\n\n# Read in fish and coral data \nfish &lt;- read_csv(here(\"blogposts\", \"corallivores\", \"data\", \"MCR_LTER_Annual_Fish_Survey_20250324.csv\")) |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ncoral_cover &lt;- read_csv(here(\"blogposts\", \"corallivores\", \"data\", \"MCR_LTER_Coral_Cover_Backreef_Long_20250429.csv\")) |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names()"

    "text": "Marine aquaculture has the potential to play an important role in the global food supply as a more sustainable protein option than land-based meat production 1 Gentry et al. mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, and bottom depth. They found that global seafood demand could be met using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area 2. Additionally, aquaculture contributed $885.7 million (USD) to the U.S Western Region and supported more than 6,000 jobs in 2022 3. Shellfish alone, accounted for $360.6 million of this total amount. Placement of aquaculture farms along the coast for a particular species needs to be given special consideration.

    "text": "Is there a relationship between decreasing coral cover and corallivore abundance in backreef sites around Mo’orea, French Polynesia?\nCoral reefs around the islands of Moʻorea are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic and natural stressors, such as cyclone activity and outbreaks of the predatory sea star (Acanthaster planci), which feeds on coral tissue.¹ In response to these stressors, many locations around the island have undergone phase shifts in their benthic composition, transforming coral‑dominated communities into macroalgae‑dominated ones.² In particular, the back‑reefs have been heavily transformed by the presence of Turbinaria ornata, a well‑defended and persistent alga.³ I am interested in whether the resulting fish communities have changed as a result, especially the abundance of corallivores that feed primarily on scleractinian corals. In the following analysis, I will assess the impact of changing coral cover on corallivore populations.\nThe analysis involves two datasets, both from the Moʻorea Coral Reef Long‑Term Ecological Research (LTER) site.\n\nLong‑term Population and Community Dynamics: Fishes (ongoing since 2005)⁴ – describes species abundance and estimated size distributions (total body length to the greatest precision possible) of fishes surveyed as part of MCR LTER’s annual reef‑fish monitoring program. This dataset will be filtered to back‑reef sites and the fine trophic level of corallivore. Corallivores were not recorded group in the first year of the survey so 2005 will be excluded.\nLong‑term Community Dynamics: Backreef (Lagoon) Corals Annual Survey (ongoing since 2005)⁵ – describes the percentage cover of all stony corals (Scleractinia, pooled among genera) and other major groups, analyzed from 0.5 × 0.5 m photographic quadrats at the back‑reef habitat of the Moorea Coral Reef LTER, French Polynesia.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Read in fish and coral data \nfish &lt;- read_csv(here(\"blogposts\", \"corallivores\", \"data\", \"MCR_LTER_Annual_Fish_Survey_20250324.csv\")) |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ncoral_cover &lt;- read_csv(here(\"blogposts\", \"corallivores\", \"data\", \"MCR_LTER_Coral_Cover_Backreef_Long_20250429.csv\")) |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names()"

The 95% confidence interval ranged from approximately zero to 0.016, indicating considerable uncertainty around the estimate and suggesting that the true effect, while unlikely to be negative, may be very weak. This relationship was not statistically significant (p = 0.050033), falling just above the conventional threshold for significance. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between mean site coral cover and proportion corallivore in the backreef fish community. Because of potential site-level heterogeneity, further analyses examining site-specific effects may help clarify how coral cover influences corallivore abundance in the backreefs of Mo’orea, French Polynesia.\nReferences\n\nTrapon, Mélanie L., Pratchett, Morgan S., Penin, Lucie, Comparative Effects of Different Disturbances in Coral Reef Habitats in Moorea, French Polynesia, Journal of Marine Sciences, 2011, 807625, 11 pages, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/807625\nAdam TC, Schmitt RJ, Holbrook SJ, Brooks AJ, Edmunds PJ, Carpenter RC, et al. (2011) Herbivory, Connectivity, and Ecosystem Resilience: Response of a Coral Reef to a Large-Scale Perturbation.
