         This dataset contains the percentage cover of all stony corals (Scleractinia, pooled among genera) and other major groups analyzed from 0.5 x 0.5 m photographic quadrats at the Backreef habitat at the Moorea Coral Reef LTER, French Polynesia. This survey time series began in 2005 and is repeated each year in April. Functional groups counted are: Scleractinian corals, Macroalgae, Crustose Coralline Algae / Bare Space, Soft Corals, Hydrocorals (        Millepora
), Algal Turf and Sand. The coral community was sampled photographically in all represented habitats surrounding the island: Fringing Reef, Lagoon, and Outer Reef. This dataset contains only Lagoon (Backreef) data (see knb-lter-mcr.4 for the other habitats) and is structured in a repeated-measures protocol to allow a statistical contrast of sites, shores and times. Community structure was determined through a coarse analysis of the benthic community, initially completed in situ (2005), but using photoquadrats from 2006. There are quadrats analyzed at each of five areas within each site, and the areas are revisited (but not the quadrats) each year to support the repeated measures design. There are two tables available, providing different views of the same data: a long table having all values in one column and a wide table having a separate column for each observed object. Detailed methods are available in the protocols section.

                  Photoquadrats
                  Quantitative high resolution digital images form 2006-present (              in situ
counts in 2005).
               
               
                  Sampling
                  The sampling strategy was designed to facilitate tests of the effect of time and shore on the coral community structure of the backreef habitats of Moorea. The backreef habitat within the lagoon and may be synonymous with lagoon habitats in other studies. The sampling design was implemented to accommodate the high spatial variation in the lagoon, and therefore quadrats along a transect were not employed. Instead, each site was characterized by 5 randomly selected patches over a spatial scale of ~50m. At each point, a cardinal axis design was implemented where quadrats were sampled along N, S, E and W axes centered on each patch. Each axis was 5 m long, and 5 quadrats (0.5 x 0.5 m) were scattered randomly along the axis; the position is re-randomized each year. This design is a nested, factorial ANOVA experimental design in which shore of Moorea (north, southeast, or southwest) was treated as a fixed factor, site (LTER 1 through LTER 6) as a random factor nested within shore, and time was a repeated measures factor based on five patches at each site. Depending on the analytical goals, the community structure at each patch can be characterized by averaging all 20 quadrats, or the quadrats can be treated as a nested factor in each patch.
                  The census methods were designed to quantify coral community structure in terms of the dominant constituents of the benthic community - scleractinian corals, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, sand, algal turf, and Millepora. The benthos is recorded with digital images every year and the resolution of the images generally increases across the study as the resolution of DSLR cameras has increased with time. 2020 was an unusual year when sampling was perturbed by the COVID pandemic. This year, lower resolution images were taken with a GoPro camera in late August.
                  QA/QC of the data in April 2021 revealed ongoing challenges of accurately distinguishing among algal turf, crustose coralline algae, and bare space, and therefore, the categories were combined across the whole study to “CTB” (summation of the three categories). These groups are resolved in data set (knb.lter.mcr.8) which describes the results of surveys conducted in situ by RC Carpenter.
                  All census methods were designed to quantify coral community structure in terms of the dominant constituents of the benthic community - scleractinian corals, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, sand, algal turf, and millepora.
               
               
                  Parameters for Photoquadrat Analysis
                  For the purpose of analysis of the benthic community, the quadrats are divided into 25 equal squares (5 x 5 cm) and each square is scored for the benthic category (one of 6 categories as above) that dominates (i.e., ≥ 50% cover) that area. The limit of resolution is 4% change in cover. Identification has been done by various graduate students and technicians and the investigator. The images can be analyzed for coral cover at the genus level (as is accomplished in the outer reef and fringe habitats), but currently this analysis is incomplete for the back reef (2008 and 2009 are available).
               
            
         
         
            
               
                  Blue Water
                  The backreef habitat in the lagoons is relatively shallow. There is a minimum depth needed to position the camera frame over corals and still be under water. When a quadrat is too shallow, the photo may be tilted off horizontal so that part of the photo is open water, called "blue water", instead of benthic cover. This makes the photoquadrat inappropriate for percent cover analysis. For these photoquadrats the code "BW" is entered in place of coral cover percent.

            This material uses data collected by the U.S. National Science Foundation's (NSF) Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) site under Grant No. OCE 2224354 (and earlier awards). Additional financial support to the MCR LTER site was provided through a generous gift from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Research was completed under permits issued by the French Polynesian Government (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-commissariat de la République en Polynésie Francaise (DTRT) (Protocole d'Accueil 2005-2025).
            
            With respect to the spelling of Moorea, we followed the Raapoto transcription system that is adhered to by a large segment of the Tahitian community but also recognizes other community members follow the Te Fare Vāna’a transcription system where the island name is spelled with an ’eta (Mo’orea).
