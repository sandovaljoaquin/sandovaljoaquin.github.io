         These data describe the estimated species abundances and individual sizes of fishes surveyed in late July or early August of each year by researchers associated with the Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research site. This study began in 2005, and the dataset is updated annually. Divers using SCUBA estimate the number and total length (total body length to the greatest precision possible) of all mobile and semi-cryptic fishes observed on four 50m long transects within each of the three principal habitat types, fore reef, back reef, and fringing reef, found around Moorea.  These three habitats are each surveyed at six permanently marked sites, two sites on each of Moorea's three shores, yielding a total of 18 unique habitats (3) by location (6) combinations and 72 transects. Estimated total lengths are converted to estimates of species biomass using published length-weight relationships for each species. Data from the initial survey conducted in 2005 are presented in a separate data table as the protocol used in 2005 differed from the standard protocol adopted in 2006, and no estimates of fish body lengths were made in 2005. These data are a component of the MCR LTER core time series program and provide insight into the spatial and temporal patterns of reef fish abundance and biomass around the island of Moorea, French Polynesia.

               These data describe the estimated species abundances and individual sizes of fishes surveyed in August of each year by researchers associated with the Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research site. This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant No. OCE 22-24354 (and earlier awards) as well as a generous gift from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Research was completed under permits issued by the French Polynesian Government (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-commissariat de la République en Polynésie Francaise (DTRT) (Protocole d'Accueil 2005-2025). This work represents a contribution of the Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) LTER Site.
            
         
         
            
               Diver Observations:
               
               This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. Data from the initial survey conducted in 2005 are presented in a separate data table as the methods used differed from the standard protocol adopted in 2006 and no estimates of fish body lengths were made. Each year, surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (local time) during a six to 10 day period in late July or early August. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), six locations in the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small, stainless-steel eyebolts affixed to the reef. Divers use pencils and data sheets pre-printed on waterproof paper affixed to ruled (cm increments) dive slates to record the estimated number and total body lengths of fishes observed on each transect. Species listed on the pre-printed data sheets are unique to each habitat type. Species not pre-printed on the data sheets are added by a diver to blank space provided on the data sheet for this purpose.
            
         
         
            
               2005 Surveys only:
               
               In 2005, a pair of divers using SCUBA swam side by side, down the center of a 5 m by 50 m transect. One diver estimated the abundance of all fishes throughout the entire water column from the bottom to the surface from the center of the transect line out to 2.5 m to the left of the center line, while the other diver estimated the abundances of all fishes throughout the entire water column from the bottom to the surface from the center of the transect line out to 2.5 m to the right of the center line. Divers did not attempt to estimate the sizes of the fishes observed. Data from this initial survey are presented but should be used with a great deal of caution as divers may have double-counted individuals moving across the entire 5 m width of the transect or did not count individuals that they mistakenly thought had been counted by the other diver. This process yielded 72 5m x 50m transects (3 habitats x 6 locations x 4 transects).
            
         
         
            
               2006 - 2021 Surveys:
               
               From 2006 to 2021, the estimated abundances and body lengths (total body length to greatest precision possible) of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) observed on a 5 m by 50 m transect extending from the bottom to the surface of the water column were recorded by a single diver using SCUBA. After completing the initial survey, the diver then swam back along a 1 m by 50 m band down the center of the original transect line and recorded the estimated abundances and body lengths of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids, etc). This process yields 72 5m x 50m transects (3 habitats x 6 locations x 4 transects) and 72 1m x 50m transects (3 habitats x 6 locations x 4 transects) from each annual survey.
            
         
         
            
               2022 - Present Surveys:
               
               Beginning in 2022, to provide an increased degree of diver safety, the abundance and body lengths of fishes on each transect are estimated by two pairs of divers using SCUBA. One diver pair surveys Transects 1 and 2, and the second diver pair surveys Transects 3 and 4. Within each pair, the lead diver estimates the abundances and body lengths of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) observed on a 5 m by 50 m transect extending from the bottom to the surface of the water column. The second diver trailing approximately 5 m behind the lead diver estimates the abundances and body lengths of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids, etc) on a 1 m by 50 m band down the center of the transect. Divers switch between the lead (5m swath) and following (1m swatch) diver positions between transects so that the diver conducting the 5m wide transect is the same diver that surveyed both the 1m and 5m swaths on that transect prior to 2022.  This process yields 72 5m x 50m transects (3 habitats x 6 locations x 4 transects) and 72 1m x 50m transects (3 habitats x 6 locations x 4 transects) from each annual survey.
            
         
         
            
               Locations:
               
               Locations for the MCR LTER site annual fish census locations are designated with four components in a stratified design: 6 sites, 3 habitats, 4 transects, 2 swaths (1 m or 5 m transect width). The six MCR-LTER sites span the three shores of the roughly triangular island of Moorea with Sites 1 and 2 on the north-facing shore, Sites 3 and 4 on the south-east facing shore, and Sites 5 and 6 on the south-west facing shore. Sites on a given side of the island are located at least 3 km apart. Individual transects within a given site and habitat are positioned end to end parallel to either shore or the barrier reef and are separated by approximately 5 m. Transects on the fore reef are located at a depth of approximately 12m, those in the back reef portion of the lagoons are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m.
               
               Caution should be used if analyzing these data using individual transects within a given site and habitat combination as replicates.  Individual transects may not be statistically independent of each other within a given site by habitat combination.
            
         
         
            
               Divers:
               
               Whenever possible, the same diver covered the same transect number within each habitat type at each site each year. The diver censusing Transect 3 has varied over time and users may want to exclude data recorded on this transect to minimize observed temporal and spatial differences that are due to the identity of the observer. The diver censusing each transect is identified in the data table by their initials. In 2005, the initials of 2 divers are concatenated.
            
         
         
            
               Dive Conditions:
               
               In addition to the biotic data collected, divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed, wind speed and sea state, swell height in m, amount of cloud cover in %, and horizontal visibility in m. Dive conditions are recorded for each dive, which is unique to a habitat at a site for a given year. Therefore, there are 18 unique dive conditions each year (3 habitats at 6 sites).
            
         
         
            
               QA/QC protocol:
               All divers inspect their own datasheets at the end of each dive day and resolve any questions about species identifications through discussions with the other divers or by consulting a number of published books on the identification of coral reef-associated fishes. Each diver then enters their observations into an Excel spreadsheet, one transect per Excel tab, pre-populated with site id, habitat type, species names, and other information specific to each diver, e.g. transect number, and diver initials. Having divers enter their own data minimizes errors resulting from a separate person having to decipher a diver's handwriting or shorthand codes.
               
               Once all data have been entered, the four Excel workbooks, each containing 36 tabs for the 18 5m wide swaths and 18 1m wide swaths surveyed by a given diver, are concatenated into a single Excel spreadsheet. Species that were not observed at a given site by habitat by transect combination are deleted from the dataset.  Users should note that this procedure produces a sparse dataset.  Analyses that involve calculating metrics such average species abundance within a site across transects or island wide averages for species abundances using sites as replicates will need to account for missing zeros on transects or sites where that species was not observed. Basic error checking is performed on the concatenated dataset by examing the observations for missing count or length values or out of range values for site number or transect number. More complete error checking is performed by running a series of SQL scripts that identify species whose taxonomy does not agree with established species lists for French Polynesia, individuals whose estimated body length exceeds the maximum recorded published body length for that species, or individuals whose estimated body length exceeds twice the standard deviation of the average estimated body length for all individuals of that species observed during all transects surveyed in that year. Individuals with anomolous total body lengths are flagged with a "1" in the column designated Length Anomoly.  Species taxonomy is harmonized with accepted taxonomy using published species lists for French Polynesia and several online resources. While it is recognized that parrotfishes are correctly classified as members of the Family Labridae, Sub-family Scarinae, we have chosen to maintain the more traditional classification of including the parrotfishes in the Family Scaridae to make sorting of the wrasses and parrotfishes easier.
            
         
         
            
               Estimation of species-specific biomass: 
               
               Species biomass is calculated using published length/weight relationships applied to estimated total body lengths and the formula Biomass(g) = a*Total Body Length (cm)^b, where a and b represent species-specific coefficients obtained from several online databases and published values. When required, values for total body length were converted to estimated body lengths expressed as fork length (FL) in cm or standard length (SL) in cm using the expression Standard Length/Fork Length (cm) = a*Total Length (cm) where a represents a species specific coefficent obtained from several online databases and published values.
            
         
         
            
               Assignment of Trophic Level:
               
               Coarse and fine species-specific trophic levels are assigned using information obtained from several online databases and published values.  Fine trophic levels represent more specific trophic classifications within the coarse trophic levels of Primary Consumer, Secondary Consumer, Planktivore, and Piscivore_primarily.

            This material uses data collected by the U.S. National Science Foundation's (NSF) Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) site under Grant No. OCE 2224354 (and earlier awards). Additional financial support to the MCR LTER site was provided through a generous gift from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Research was completed under permits issued by the French Polynesian Government (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-commissariat de la République en Polynésie Francaise (DTRT) (Protocole d'Accueil 2005-2025).
            
            With respect to the spelling of Moorea, we followed the Raapoto transcription system that is adhered to by a large segment of the Tahitian community but also recognizes other community members follow the Te Fare Vāna’a transcription system where the island name is spelled with an ’eta (Mo’orea).
